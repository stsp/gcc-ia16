/* Comparison modes.  The basic CCmode contains all of the Sign,
   Carry, Overflow and Zero flags.  The rest of the modes only contain

   instead of the zero flag.  */

/* This mode is used when making an equality comparison using the carry flag

   Only the carry flag is set and it is negated.  */

/* This mode is used when making an unsigned comparison against an immediate
   and the result would normally require both carry and zero flags (LEU and

   GT and GE) in these modes are only valid against zero.  They are therefore
   incompatible with the ones which set both the sign and overflow flags.  */

/* GE and LT can use this mode when comparing against zero.  */
CC_MODE (CCS);

/* As above, but instead of setting the sign flag, it sets the carry flag. The
   sense of the carry flag is inverted.  */
CC_MODE (CCS_NC);

/* This mode is used when the zero and overflow flags aren't set correctly.
   For example by SImode/DImode/TImode plus/minus patterns.  */

/* GT and LE can use this mode when comparing against zero, but we seem to
   have no jump instruction (in hardware) for it.
   This mode is used by the inc/dec instructions.  */

/* This mode is used when the overflow flag isn't set correctly.
   For example by the add/sub/neg instructions.  */
